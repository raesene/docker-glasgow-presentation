# Docker Glasgow Presentation

Presentation for my Docker Glasgow Talk in May 2016

## Software

Created using [Reveal.JS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) and [Jekyll-Reveal.JS](https://github.com/dploeger/jekyll-revealjs).

To run just clone the repo and do ```jekyll serve -H 127.0.0.1```

## Source and Notes

The source for the presentation in terms of content is the markdown file in _posts.  It renders reasonably nicely in github so you can see it [here](https://github.com/raesene/docker-glasgow-presentation/blob/master/_posts/1-1-1-1-Introduction.md)
